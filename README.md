# Deep-Learning-on-Image-Classification
## Project Overview

In this project, you will evaluate **CNNs**, **RNNs**, and potentially combinations of **CNN+RNN** architectures. You may also explore neural network topics beyond what we cover in class. These include, but are not limited to:
- **Generative Models** (e.g., GANs, VAEs)
- **Transformer Architectures**
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**

## Creativity Requirement
To encourage exploration, **evaluating an RNN or another post-CNN algorithm is mandatory**. Failure to do so will result in a loss of creativity points as outlined in the rubric at the end of this document.

## Project Objective
The goal is to:
- **Optimize performance** on a particular task, or
- **Apply a technique** to a research area of interest.

You may use any tools to implement these networks, such as **PyTorch**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, etc. The assumption is that you already understand the principles of training, backpropagation, and optimization, and are ready to use these frameworks that handle many of these operations for you.

## Datasets and Custom Projects
You may use the datasets provided below or choose a project related to your own research/interests. If you're pursuing a custom project:
- **Approval is required**. Please email Prof. Kao directly to get approval.
- Projects must explore a **post-CNN topic** to be considered.
- Custom project proposals must be submitted by **Friday, 1 March 2024**. No approval will be granted after this date.

## Team Guidelines
You may work individually or in groups of up to **4 people**. To find teammates, use the **"Search for Teammates"** functionality on Piazza: [Search for Teammates](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48001158117-search-for-teammates).
